I am Radhika Garg and I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing my Bachelors at the UTK CS department. I have been taking CS courses for three years and was doing a CS internship over the summer. I enjoy cooking, playing board games, and spending time with my sister. In terms of work/study, I like to write code, and I have interest in Artificial Intelligence, especially understanding how it works on the lower level. I also think Mobile Apps are nice - being able to see everything on a small screen.
