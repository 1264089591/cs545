I am Eric Vaughan, and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration.
Most of experience thus far has been in full-stack development, and I have experience through Sam's Club, 
Trimble Inc., and undergraduate research. This year, I am interested in shifting my focus to machine learning 
and data analysis. I hope to acquire a basic understanding of these areas through this course, and I plan on 
further exploring them in graduate school. In my free time, I really enjoy playing sports, such as soccer and 
table tennis. I also like watching sports and will cheer on the Vols any chance that I get. Additionally, 
I enjoy hiking and kayaking through nature.
