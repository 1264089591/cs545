Hi, I am Shahinul Hoque and I am a 2nd year PhD student majoring in Computer Science. I like to code and work in various robotic projects. I am interested in appying Machine Learning on various data sources and optimizing the results to solve new and complex problems. My research work focuses on the security aspect of Machine Learning and maintaining the privacy aspect of the data sources used to train Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. From this course, I am interested in learning how various organizations generate, process, and handle operational data and what steps they take in order to maintain the privacy aspect of the generated operational data and various data sources. I believe, this course will help me to get a better understanding of handling data and various data properties.
