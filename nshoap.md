I am Noah Shoap and I am a senior majoring in CS.  I've interned twice with a company called AVEVA. 
I enjoy games and am mildly interested in game development.  I'm still figuring out my interests within computer science but plan to learn more about machine learning.  Outside of CS, I enjoy watching football.
