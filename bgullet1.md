I am Bryson Gullett and I am a senior majoring in computer engineering and minoring in machine learning. I work on campus for the TENNLab neuromorphic computing group as part of the ongoing effort of designing efficient brain-based computing hardware and software. I like embedded systems, robotics, and machine learning. Therefore, I would like to learn how to extract clean data in this class to help me train an effective ML model.
