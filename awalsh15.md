My name is Anderson Walsh. I am a senior studying computer science. In the past, I have worked for Samsung Austin Semiconductor on Android emulations for GPU hardware/firmware testing. Currently, I work for a startup primarily doing full stack web development in the healthcare sector. This work has me interested in handling medical data for diagnostic/predictive purposes.
