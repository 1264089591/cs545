I am Jake Shoffner and I am a senior in computer science in the 5 Year MS/BS program. I have worked as a research assistant in condensed matter physics, teaching assistant for DATA201, and am currently working as a software engineer at KUB. I have taken a lot of statistics classes in the arts and sciences department, as well as data mining last semester with Dr. Taufer. I like coding because it allows me to build things myself without relying on others to build it for me.
