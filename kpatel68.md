My name is Karan Patel and I'm a graduate student pursuing a degree in computer engineering at the EECS department under Dr. Schuman. I have done software internships at OSISoft/Aveva and Denso as well as research at the Neuromorphic group at the EECS department. I am interested in embedded systems and machine learning, and I hope this class will help me handle large data for data science and machine learning purposes.
