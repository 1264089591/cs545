# Jack Skupien
I am Jack Skupien, and I am a senior at UTK studying Computer Science with a minor in ML & AI. I have worked as a software developer for a few years in the automotive and healthcare fields. I am taking this class because it seemed like a fresh and interesting topic that I don't know much about. I am also starting to work more in the data analysis field and would love to have more skill with it.
