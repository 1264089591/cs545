I am Jared Staman. I am a first year Masters student in Computer Science. I am also a GTA for CS 102. I have experience using Python and have done a good bit of machine learning with it. I am interested in doing data analysis in sports. Specifically, I have been enjoying frisbee golf lately so I would love to try to make a project out of that, but I'm definitely open to other sports.
