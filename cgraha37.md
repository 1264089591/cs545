I am Christian Graham and I am a graduating senior in the Computer Science BS program. My hobbies include thrifting, writing, building community, and plant-keeping. I am hoping to begin work in the UX/UI space after graduation but I would also like to build my web development skills. I took this class because the title sounded adventurous and I am interested in improving how I collect, process, and store data. I am also interested in understanding what exactly "archeology" means in this context.
