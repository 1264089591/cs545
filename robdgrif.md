I am Robert Griffith and I am a senior at UTK majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cybersecurity. My hobby is mostly gaming and I am also into plants. 
The reason why I am taking this course is to mainly learn more about what Computer Science can do and try to branch out and learn about different topics.
