I am Jovan (Jovi) Yoshioka and I am a fourth-year student majoring in computer science with minors in machine learning, data science, and 
integrated business and engineering. After graduating, I hope to either go into the software engineering industry or pursue graduate school 
to study robotics. I have interned at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Microsoft where I have had the opportunity to work with data.
With interest in both machine learning and data science, I am excited to strengthen my data-oriented skills. I especially enjoy the problem solving 
aspect of data science, gaining insights from potentially scrambled data.
