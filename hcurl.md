# Hayden Curl
My name is Hayden Curl and I am a undergraduate senior majoring in CS. I have worked at two internships, both with National Aerospace Solutions. Some of my interests include Python programming and cyber security, specifically network security. I am very excited to take this course and am looking forward to learning.
