I am Clay Shubert and I am in my first semester as a graduate student. I currently am a GTA for the COSC483/583 course Applied Cryptography. I am working on a masters degree with thesis and my area of research is related to the user experience with mTLS or TLS client authentication. In my free time, I enjoy watching sports including soccer, basketball, and football. I am a big fan of Nashville SC, the Atlanta Hawks, and the Tennessee Vols. I also like to play video games and spend time with my wife and our new cat.
