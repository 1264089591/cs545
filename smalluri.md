Hi, my name is Saish Malluri, and I am currently a senior undergradate studying computer science. My interests are playing sports, exercising, and watching movies. I don't have that much experience in this field, but I would like to keep on learning and have enough knowledge about Digital Archaeology as a whole by the end of the semester.
