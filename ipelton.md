Hi, my name is Imani Pelton. I am a graduate student pursuing his Master's degree in Computer Science. I am a Chattanooga native and am a big fan of trying new restaurants and exploring new cities. Recently, I made it a goal for myself to visit as many state and national parks as possible (I think I've got about 25 combined right now this year!). My primary interests are software development, particularly in Rust, and linguistics.
