I am Heather Haynie. I am a master's student in Computer Engineering. I focus in the machine learning space, most recently the 
tinyML space which aims to apply machine learning to low powered devices. Most of the professional experience I have through
interning combines machine learning with signal processing. I don't have any specific learning goals for this class
other than I'm just excited to hopefully learn some new skills and maybe learn how to apply new skills in ways I might
not have thought of otherwise!
