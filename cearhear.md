I am Carter Earheart-Brown. I am pursuing a bachelor's in computer engineering. I have no experience
with data science, so I am hoping to learn a lot. I have used python some before, but I also want to use this class
to develop those skills more. My interests outside of the class involve music technology, art, recording, and audio. 
My goal is to work for a guitar pedal or synthesizer company.
