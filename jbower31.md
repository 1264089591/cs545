My name is Justin Bowers, and I am a senior studying computer science. I really enjoy working with data and using it to solve meaningful problems. I took Data Mining and Analysis last semester, so this class was a good option to expand upon skills I built there. Some projects I have worked on include political analysis, financial data, and I would like to get into utilizing data for automotive performance. This class sounds interesting, and I look forward to what is to come from it.
