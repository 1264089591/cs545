I am Alexander Brock and I am a Computer Science major in (hopefully) my final semester at UTK. I enjoy programming close to the OS/kernel level as well as writing scripts to scrape and interpret data for games and websites. It is my goal to continue developing these skills while also working in the industry to obtain better knowledge and long term financial stability.
