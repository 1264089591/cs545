Hi everyone, my name is Nik and I am a third year computer science major. My hobbies include video games and the Model UN club on campus
where I am the captain of the travel team. I am excited to take this class to refine my skills with python and data analysis following CS 370, which I completed this 
summer. I dont think I fully understand digital archeology or its uses, which is why I am in this class! If given the choice, I think I would like to work with a novel
 or other piece of media as a data set and try to extract additional meanin from the text.
