I am Evan Anderson, and I am a senior Computer Science student with a minor in Machine Learning. I've done summer internships in the Biosciences Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and at Vacuum Technology Incorporated. I like reading literature and learning about philosophy and religion. I also enjoy camping, hiking, and playing music. I would be excited to engage in a data-driven exploration of any of these topics, and in general I'm excited for this course!
