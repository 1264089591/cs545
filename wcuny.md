 ## Intro
  My name is Will Cuny. I am a senior majoring in computer science with a minor in cyber security, and I am from Greenville, South Carolina. 
 ## Interests 
  My interests include hiking, camping and fishing. I like to travel as well, and I built a camper for my truck to be able to drive around the country. I have gone on a few different cross country trips, and have been to over 20 national parks. 
   
 ## Goal For This Class
 My goal for this class to learn more about what digital archaeology is. I also want to focus on what this class can do for me once I graduate. My goal is to be able to name key takeaways from this class, and be able to apply it in the workplace. Overall, I have no clue what digital archaeology is right now so I want to learn in depth what that entails.
