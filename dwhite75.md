Hello, my name is Darius White, and I am a senior at UTK majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cyber Security. I love making music and boxing in my free time as well as working out and playing video games. My main interests in this field are AI, web development/security, and software engineering. One dream of mine is to advance virtual reality to bring humans into a virtual reality space as well as experience all 5 senses inside it.
