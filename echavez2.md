My name is Emanuel Chavez and I am a senior in Computer Science. I enjoy rock climbing and hiking as well as casual video games. Recently I have been getting into mushroom identification as a hobby as well. I've done one internship where I worked on a website and am looking forward to learning new things in this class.
