I am Brandon Kammerdiener and I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student.
I am researching memory management techniques for heterogeneous memory systems under Dr. Michael Jantz.
For a few years, I have been writing a terminal text editor called `yed` for a fun project.
Some of my other hobbies are music and working on cars.
