Hi I am Manas Tiwari pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. Also, I'm GTA for CS302 under Dr. Plank. I am very excited about this course as I have worked previously on a couple of Machine learning project, and I'm also interested in data science. Hence, I think having this course under my belt will add layers to my knowledge. I look forward toward completing this class successfully.
