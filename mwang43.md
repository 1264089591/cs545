My name is Mengjun Wang, and I am a third-year PhD civil engineering student. 
My research mostly focuses on civil engineering automation and computing. 
In addition, I am pursuing a concurrent master's degree in computer science. 
With the advancement of artificial intelligence, I believe industry 4.0 will be a reality in the very near future, so we engineers should have good computer skills.
