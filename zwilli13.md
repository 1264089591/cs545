My name is Zach Williams, and I am majoring in computer engineering.
I have many interests inside and outside of computer engineering.
Within the broad scope of computer engineering I am interested in machine learning and AI development.
I am also interested in cybersecurity, and data management.
While these are simply just a few fields, I cannot think of any specific field that I would be completely disinterested in.
Many facets of engineering are extremely complex and because of this complexity I can find interest somewhere in almost any category.
Outside of computer engineering, I love the outdoors and Jesus.
Jesus is my personal Lord and Savior and because of this I have devoted to life to His glory.
I also have a beautiful Labraheeler puppy named Forest, and I enjoy spending a lot of time with him.
