My name is Finli Hill.
In my brief introduction in class, I spoke about how this class was recommended to me by a previous student of the course. They told me that FDAC would help develope my skills in a few key areas, namley software development,
team work, and most importantly data science. I have only had one course roughly related to these areas (CS340), so any course in the UTK cirriculum that focuses on them is highly valuable in my opinion. 
I am also taking CS425 (Intro to Machine Learning) in conjuction with this course. I am looking forward to seeing how the information I get from this course benefits me there and vice versa.
