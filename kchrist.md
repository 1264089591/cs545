I am Kellan Christ, a 2nd year Grad student here at UT. I attended UNCC where I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Cyber Security and am currently studying Cyber Security as well. Before returning back to school I worked at Equitable as a security Analyst and Security engineer. I am interested in this class due to the data science aspect as that is important withing CS and the current world.
