Hi, my name is Cade Brown and I'm a senior CS undergraduate. I've worked at multiple labs on campus (Innovative Computing Lab, PAIRS Lab), and at NVIDIA and ORNL doing machine learning and high performance computing research primarily. I also have a personal interset in programming language theory and compiler design. I hope to use this class to aid in my understanding of massive data organization.
