# Introduction
### Andrew Lay
I am a senior in computer science and currently working part time at ORNL. I have TAed for CS202 and CS302 and helped with a supply chain club before. I feel that I have a good ammount of experience in diffrent fields of computer science but I am expecting this class to teach me some new things.
