I am Jennifer Maranville, and I am a senior computer science major student. I have not found what really interests me in CS yet, and I am hoping to find my niche this semester. From this class, I want to learn about data science and find out whether it is a topic that interests me. I am taking many upper division electives this semester, and they all sound interesting. My hobbies outside of class are yoga, reading, sewing, and hanging out with my son and cats. I'm looking forward to a good semester!
