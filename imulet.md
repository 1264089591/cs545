I am Ian Mulet and I am a 2nd year master student in Dr. Jantz lab. I have an interest in systems programming and low level programming in general.
Also I have interests in emulation and operating systems, and would like to design my own language in the future. Other than programming I really like playing guitar, working on cars, and games.
This class interests me because I work with large data sets and data that we work with and produce so having good skills related to analysis, reproducibility, and context would greatly help my research capabilities.
