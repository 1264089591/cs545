I am Ankit Mistry and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science. My area of interest is Software Development, particularly Web Development.
I acquired experience in Web Development (almost full stack) this summer doing an internship. A little background on me, I am from Knoxville, TN and 
I really like playing video games in my free time and my second area of interest is cars. I love to reaseach on them and learn about the mechanical 
stuff about them.
