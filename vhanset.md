I am Victor Hanset. I am in my fourth year at UTK, studying Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security. I enjoy going outside and playing many varieties of games with friends. In the past, I have played around with basic game design and hope to continue exploring in the field. My current work revolves around Web and Cloud Development. The course description of this class intruiged me a lot, aand revolves around skills that I know very little about. Overall, I hope to learn skills that I am able to actively use in the future.
