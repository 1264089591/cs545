My name is Zack Malkmus and I am a junior pursuing a bachelors in computer science and I currently work for Jewelry Television in Knoxville doing web development. I love playing games and solving puzzles that challenge my brain to grow. I'm not sure exactly what career path in computer science I want to take, but I know I love coding and coming up with creative ways to solve problems. I know somewhere along the line I will find what I want to do.
