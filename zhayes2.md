Hello, my name is Zackery Hayes, I'm a senior in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. Outside of the classroom, most of my tech experience has been in IT support where I've worked in my local public school IT department and I'm currently working at the Haslam Business College doing IT for their Executive Graduate Programs. My interests include video games, cars, racing, and table-top RPGs.
