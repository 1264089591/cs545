I am a Senior majoring in Computer Science. I want to increase my data science skills for the future and gain valuable skills that I will be able to use in the workforce. I took introduction to data mining and loved it and figured that this would be a good transition to the minor that I am pursuing in machine learning. I heard that this was a fun class and that it helped increase skill and knowledge so I decided to go ahead and sign up for it. I am looking forward to working on projects in this class and learning how to work better as a team as up until now majority of my work has been individual. I also have a minor in Cybersecurity, AI, and Machine Learning.
