I am Braxton Haynie, and I am a computer engineering masters student in the EECS dept. While at school, I work in the TENNLAB on algorithms and embedded hardware, but outside of school I have had multiple internships at Northrop Grumman and AWS. My interests include embedded systems, machine learning, and image processing. I also have some experience with data science, but it mostly just involves its use in ML.
