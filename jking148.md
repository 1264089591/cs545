I am Jacob King and I am a senior in Computer Science here at UTK. I am currently in the progress of obtaining my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in cybersecurity. I am a student worker at Knoxville Utilities Board working in their software development department. I enjoy making cool things with code as well learning about security protocols and how to be secure in a cyber world. I would like to learn about data through this class and specifically ways to secure it.
