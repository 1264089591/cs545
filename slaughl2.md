My name is Sean Laughlin and I am a Senior in Computer Science.

I am taking this class because it was recommended to me by a friend and I have had a recent interest in Data Science.
I'm hoping that this class will allow me to learn enough about the field to see if I would like to pursue it further
or not. I've also heard that this class is also just a good experience overall.
