Hi my name is Alex Hickman. I am a senior computer science student pursuing also a minor in cybersecurity. I don't have a lot of experience or know-how in what the majority of the class will be about. I am definitely hoping to learn a lot and just see how important data can be with the right lense. I think some interesting data points would be something dealing with sports or music as those are two of my main interests.
