I am Logan Oneal amd I am a senior undergraduate student studying computer science. From this class, I want to learn how to better understand data and model information. I am interested application development and want to get more exposure to ML / data science to build new projects. In my free time I enjoy cooking, listening to podcasts, and weightlifting.
