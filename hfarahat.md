I am Hadeer Farahat, a second year PhD student in Computer Science. I received my Master's degree from Egypt; my thesis was about "video coding using GPU". I am working with ICL (Innovative Computing Laboratory) for my research. I work as a GRA at the OIT (Office of Information Technology) with the websites team. I enjoy coding and parallel programming. I registered for this class to understand some basics about data science.
