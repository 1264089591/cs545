I am Mason Hyman and I am currently a senior in computer science, minoring in cybersecurity and machine learning. I am interested in cyber incident response in conjunction with machine learning which is why I chose to take this course. I am hoping to enhance my skillset such that I am better prepared to take a job in industry. I am also an avid rock climber with a strong enjoyment for the outdoors.
