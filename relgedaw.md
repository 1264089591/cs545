Hello. My name is Ran Elgedawy. I am a first year PhD student. I am excited for this course because I know a very crucial step in dealing with 
machine learning and deep learning algorithms is to analyze and preprocess data.
My hobbies are mostly any outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, and white water rafting. I also enjoy playing basketball, I was a professional basketball player before starting grad school.
