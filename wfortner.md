I am Wesley Fortner and I am a senior in computer engineering. I am interested in cybersecurity and network security. This class topic sounded interesting to me so I decided to take it. I would like to work in a cybersecurity related field following graduation. This class seems like it will bring some good insight and knowledge that I will be able to apply in the workforce after graduation.
