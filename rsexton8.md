I am Rhett Sexton and I am a MS student with a EE major. I recently finished my JD here at the University of Tennessee and recently took the TN bar.
Also, I am a patent agent with the USPTO and will begin working on patents for my career with a firm in town. My interests include fitness, video games,
church, and spending time with my wife. I look forward to enhancing my data analyst skills in this class!
